bugs / problems
orgiginally started the project as madra maith, 
struggled with adding flex to code written with float
restarted project with a restart as bark and stride as a clean slate to start coding again and not confuse myself with what i had written.
using flexbox to create both navbar and footer.

trying to create main paragraphs with grid but failing to arrange in the manner i want 
will change to flex box to see if i can arrange as i want
used this codepen code to align index.html text https://codepen.io/egf/pen/mVxLaV
Really unhappy with the layout as its not what i have in mind but hopefully i can return to fix.

media queries for very small screens causing isses, gaps appearing in the site and areas not aligning. hero image shrinking but not centered
