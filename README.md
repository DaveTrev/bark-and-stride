bugs / problems
orgiginally started the project as madra maith, 
struggled with adding flex to code written with float
restarted project with a restart as bark and stride as a clean slate to start coding again and not confuse myself with what i had written.
using flexbox to create both navbar and footer.

trying to create main paragraphs with grid but failing to arrange in the manner i want 
will change to flex box to see if i can arrange as i want
used this codepen code to align index.html text https://codepen.io/egf/pen/mVxLaV
Really unhappy with the layout as its not what i have in mind but hopefully i can return to fix.

Started building site as desktop as apposed to mobile first then out to tablet and desktop.
next project I will start with nobile first design and work out. 
this project i do not have enough time to fix this issue
media queries for very small screens causing isses, gaps appearing in the site and areas not aligning. hero image shrinking but not centered

used unordered lists to create image gallery, tried to use text decortation:none, barking up the wrong tree, googled removing bullet points used ul style= liststlye:none; to remove.
if i could figure out how to remove i had planned to change gallery around DIVS 

For the purpose of the project, I am going to direct the submit button to the code insitute web page
