bugs / problems
orgiginally started the project as madra maith, 
struggled with adding flex to code written with float
restarted project with a restart as bark and stride as a clean slate to start coding again and not confuse myself with what i had written.
using flexbox to create both navbar and footer.

trying to create main paragraphs with grid but failing to arrange in the manner i want 
will change to flex box to see if i can arrange as i want
used this codepen code to align index.html text https://codepen.io/egf/pen/mVxLaV
Really unhappy with the layout as its not what i have in mind but hopefully i can return to fix.

Started building site as desktop as apposed to mobile first then out to tablet and desktop.
next project I will start with nobile first design and work out. 
this project i do not have enough time to fix this issue
media queries for very small screens causing isses, gaps appearing in the site and areas not aligning. hero image shrinking but not centered

used unordered lists to create image gallery, tried to use text decortation:none, barking up the wrong tree, googled removing bullet points used ul style= liststlye:none; to remove.
if i could figure out how to remove i had planned to change gallery around DIVS 

For the purpose of the project, I am going to direct the submit button to the code insitute web page

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

The live link can be found here - https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html 


## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
