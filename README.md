 ### Existing features

 - Responsive design that looks good on screen widths from 320px and up.
 - All external links opens in new tabs and has proper aria labels.
 - Sign up that links to a success page for the user.
  
 ### Features Left to Implement 
  
 - On the gallery page I would like to add a section of "Favourite dogs" or "Dog of the month", highlighting happy dogs and little bios on each pet.
 - Adding a map of nearby parks that are used.
 - Adding video content of dogs engaged with the walker and the surrounding area via youtube links
 - As the site is a simple three page static site, I have not created a 404 page, in the future as the features expand with potential for dead links, a 404 page will be created.
  
 ## Testing 

 - All pages have been thoroughly tested for screen sizes from 320px and up.
 - Chrome developer tools to check pages resonsiveness, Firefox, desktop pc, Ipad and android phone used to test the site.
 - The site is responsive on all screen sizes, no images are pixelated or stretched. No elements overlap.
 - I have tested that every link on the site works as intended, opens in the correct tab and if using a external link, opens to a new browser tab.

 ### Unfixed Bugs 
  
 While trying to build a website that is responsive across all devices, using the dimensions of a galaxy fold, the break point of 280 px in width would cause a gap on the right side of the screen. the image sizing and media queries need to address this.

 In future versions I would aim to massivily increase lighthouse scoring.

 The index page, I would like to have figured out a way to have the dog be the central focus of the photo across all devices, using flexbox, the image is shifting in place depending on the device used.   
 I had originally built the site desktop first and in learning more about responsive design, I realise from the project outset, I should build mobile first and work out as it is easier to deal with issues in that manner. 

  
 ## Deployment 
  
 - The website was deployed to Github pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    - Login to Github and find the Github repository 'bark-and-stride'
    - Click on the 'Settings' button at the top of the repository
    - Click on 'Pages' on the left hand side navigation menu
    - Select 'Deploy from a branch' under 'Source' if this is not already selected
    - Under the 'Branch' drop down menus, select 'main' and 'root'
    - Click 'Save'
    - Once the page refreshes, the live link should appear underneath the 'Github Pages' title
